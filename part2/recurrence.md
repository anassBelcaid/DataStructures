The problem of [**Tower of Hanoi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) is a mathematical game or puzzle 
consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:



1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.


> Can we solve this problem? If so how?

- There is a simple proof that this problem has a solution. 

- What is funny is that the recursive proof is also a solution to show  how.

> In case you're not convinced, here is a [demo](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html) showing the result for a given size.

> The main question, is that can we solve this problem using a classical approach. 

At the end of this lecture you will be able to propose a rigourous and complete solution to this problem!!!



## [What is Recursion](#definition)


> [Recurrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_computer_science) is A common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a computer programming technique, this is called divide and conquer and is key to the design of many important algorithms.

We could ask the question how can a solve a problem by calling the same instance of that problem. The technique rely on **simplification** where each call needs a simplified version of the same problem. This reduction will continue until we hit a case where we have an answer. That case is generally called `base case`.


### [Why Recursion](#why)


**Recurrence** offers:
1. An **elegant** and simple solution  for complex problems.
2. A **powerful tool** for any serious programmer.


Also in life, recurrence is so redundant that have several examples like the  `jigsaw puzzle`:

<center>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/part2/images/hard-jigsaw-puzzle.png" width="500" height="400">
</center>


> How did solve this problem?

- You use a **recursive** procedure:
- Find a **single** correct piece.
- Continue with a **simplified** version of the puzzle.


> In order to grasp these concepts, we will follow  up with some basic examples.

###  [Counting People](#counting)

We will consider the simple problem of counting the number of people in a queue.
<center>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/part2/images/people.png"
  width="400">
</center>

The problem is that is each person could only talk to its **neighbor**. More precisely:

1. each person could only talk to the person in **front** him and **behind** him.


- **Solution**: Using recurrence

1. Each person recover the answer from the person **behind him**.

<center>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/part2/images/backward_message.png"
  width="400">
</center>

```cpp
int countPersons( Person P)
{
    if(noOneBehind(p))
        return 1;
    else
    {
        auto behind = countPersons(P.getBehind());
        
        return behind + 1;
    }
}
```

### The Three Must

In order to conceive a **recursive function** we must have the following points:

- `Base case`:  the simple case where we have an answer.

> For example, in the previous example, the person at the start knows that there is no person behind him. So the answer will be 1.

- `recurrence relation`: comes in the heart of the problem, this is how we will **reduce** the size of the problem and call a simplified version.

> In the previous example, the recurrence reside on the number of person will my answer plus the people behind me which I can call for neighbor to get me this answer.

- `convergence` : you must also assure that each reduction will lead to **basic case** at the end.


> Once all the three point are covered you take the leap of faith and be sure that your code will produce the right result.

## [Basic Examples](#examples)

In this section, we will introduce some **basic examples** to grasp those concepts.

### [Factorial](#factorial)

We will consider the example of computing the **factorial** of an integer $$n$$.

$$
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \ldots 3 \times 2 \times 1
$$


We could easily produce an `iterative` function. But we will try to produce a `recursive` solution.



We will deliberately produce two wrong versions. Your goal is to identify the **error**:

```cpp
int fact(int n)
{
    //base case
    if ( n == 1)
        return 1;
    else
        return n * n-1 * fact(n-2);
}
```

Download the code <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/part2/factorial.zip"> factorial.zip </a> 
and add this implementation to you code to check the error.

A second version is also wrong:


```cpp
int main( int n)
{
    // Base case
    if ( n== 0 || n == 1 )
        return 1;

    // Recurrence
    else
        return fact(n+1) / n;
}
```

> What is the problem of those implementation?


Finally here is the correct one:

```cpp
int main( int n)
{
    // Base case
    if ( n== 0 || n == 1 )
        return 1;

    // Recurrence
    else
        return n * fact(n-1);
}
```

> Another **intriguing** question is to how to evaluate the **complexity** of this version.


### [Power of X](#power)


Another interesting example, is to implement the function **power** of a real $$x$$ using recurrence.

```cpp
float power(float x, int n)
{
    //recursive function to compute the power of x and n
}
```


> The starting project is in  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/part2/power.zip"> power.zip </a> with simple tests.

Let's think about the following questions: 


1. What is the `base case`
2. What is the `recurrence relation`
3. What is the `complexity` of your idea.


**First try**

We will base it on the following relation.

$$

x^n = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text{if} & n=1\\[2pt]
x \times x^{n-1} & \text{else}
\end{array}\right.
$$

```cpp
float power(float x, int n)
{
    //base case
    if ( n == 0)
        return 1;
    
    //recurrence relation
    return x * power(x, n-1);
}
```

If we analyse the complexity of this function, we will find:

$$
C(n) = \underbrace{\mathcal{O}(1) + \mathcal{O}(1)  + \ldots + \mathcal{O}(1)}_{n \text{ fois}} = \mathcal{O}(n)
$$

**Second try** 

A better approach  is to use the following implementation:

$$

x^n = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text{if} & n=1\\[2pt]
x^{\frac{n}{2}}\;.\; x^{\frac{n}{2}} & \text{if} & \text{n is even}\\
x\;.\;x^{\frac{n}{2}}\;.\; x^{\frac{n}{2}} & \text{if} & \text{n is odd}\\
\end{array}\right.
$$

Which gives the following function:

```cpp
float power( float x, int n)
{
    //base case
    if ( n == 0 )
        return 1;

    // recursive call
    auto val = power(x, n/2);
    return ( n % 2 == 0) ? val * val : x * val * val;

}
```
> Later we will proove that this version has $$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$$!!!


### [Greatest Common Divisor](#pgcd)

Another classical problem is to compute the **greatest Common divisor**  of two integers using **Euclid** formula


Here is the code  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/part2/pgcd.zip">
pgcd.zip </a> with some **unit tests**.

The solution is given by:

```cpp
int pgcd(int a, int b)
{
    //base case
    if ( b == 0)
        return a;
    //recursive call
    return pgcd(b, a % b);
}
```

## [Memoization](#memoization)

In the previous sections, we illustrated the power and elegance of the **recurrence** paradigm. But we must pay a careful attention to some cases where we will **repeat the computation** of the same cases.


Let's illustrate the mechanism using the classical problem of **Fibonacci** series:

$$
\text{Fib}(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
0 & \text{if} & n = 0  \\[4pt]
1 & \text{if} & n = 1  \\[4pt]
\text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n - 2) & & n \geq 2\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$


The definition suggest a recursive approach which gives the following implemenatation:

```cpp
int fib( int n )
{
    //base case 
    if ( n == 0 || n == 1)
        return n;

    //recursive case
    return fib(n - 1) + fib( n - 2);
}

```

Try this implementation if the project <a href="{{ site.url }}}} site.baseurl }}/part2/fibonacci.zip"> Fibonacci.zip </a>.



> You will face a problem since some cases will not finish in time. This is because this implementation has **exponential** complexity.


This due to some repeated computation. Let's illustrate this for the $$\text{Fib}(4)$$.


<center>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/part2/images/fibonacci.png">
</center> 

We clearly see all the repeated computation. Hence we must use a technique called [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) in order to avoid these repetitions.

> In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing. Although related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as tabling.

Here is a code that apply this technique reducing the time complexity  to  $$ \mathcal{O}(n)$$.


```cpp
int fib_cache(int n, unoredred_set<int> & cache)
{
    // Verifiy if we already computed F(n)
    if ( cache.find(n) != cache.end())
        return cache[n];

    // recurrence
    auto val = fib_cache(n - 1) + fib_cache( n - 2);

    // store the computed value
    cache[n] = val;

    return val;
}
```


- This code, uses a **data structure** called `unordered_set`. This advantage is to store keys and check for their existence is a fast way.



## [Complexity Analysis](#complexity)


The last part of this lecture covers the [**master theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms))to compute the complexity of a recursive approach.


> In the analysis of algorithms, the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences provides an asymptotic analysis (using Big O notation) for recurrence relations of types that occur in the analysis of many divide and conquer algorithms. The approach was first presented by Jon Bentley, Dorothea Blostein (n√©e Haken), and James B. Saxe in 1980, where it was described as a "unifying method" for solving such recurrences


We denote  $$T(n)$$ the number of operations in order to solve the recursive problem of size $$n$$. If we can write $$T(n)$$ as 


$$
 T(n) = a\;T\big(\dfrac{n}{b} \big) + \mathcal{O}(n^d)
$$

We will have three cases:

1. if $$ d < \log_b a$$ then

$$
T(n) = \mathcal{O}\big(n^{\log_ba}\big)
$$

2. if $$ d = \log_b a$$ then

$$
T(n) = \mathcal{O}\big(n^d \log n\big)
$$

3. finally if  $$ d > \log_b a$$ then

$$
T(n) = \mathcal{O}\big(n^d \big)
$$

As an exercise, let's apply the master theorem to compute the complexity of the second version of **power**.

```cpp
float power( float x, int n)
{
    //base case
    if ( n == 0 )
        return 1;

    // recursive call
    auto val = power(x, n/2);
    return ( n % 2 == 0) ? val * val : x * val * val;

}
```


In this function, in every call we need a smaller problem of size $$\dfrac{n}{2}$$.


$$
T(n)  = T\big(\frac{n}{2}\big) + \mathcal{O}(1)
$$

Hence we will have the following values:
- $$ a = 1$$

- $$ b = 2$$
- $$ d = 0 $$

To determine which case, we compute $$d$$ et $$\log_b (a)$$. We have

$$
 d = 0
$$

and

$$
\log_b(a) = \log_2(1)  = 0
$$

Hence, we are in the **second** case and the complexity is given by:

$$
 T(n) = \mathcal{O}(n^d\log n) = \mathcal{O}(n^0 \log n) = \mathcal{O}(\log n)
$$
